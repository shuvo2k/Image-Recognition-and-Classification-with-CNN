# Image-Recognition-and-Classification-with-CNN
Implementation of Convolutional Nural Network with python, tensorflow and keras. The Data set has 60000 gray scale images
which have been divided into train and test set (MNIST datasets). By adjusting model parameter we can achieve more accuracy from the model.
